MTUQ Grid-Search example using GFs calculated with Specfem3D_Globe

You will find 3 directories:

1. MAKE_GFs: in this directory, you will find instructions for converting a set of synthetic seismograms calculated with Specfem_3D for 6 elementary seismic sources, into a database with the formatting to be used as Green Functions in MTUQ. 

2. MAKE_OBSERVED_DATA: in this directory, you will find instructions for converting synthetic seismograms calculated with Specfem_3D into SAC files with the formatting to be used as observed data in MTUQ.

3. MTUQ_TEST: once you have ready the Green Functions and the synthetic-observed data, you can use them for running MTUQ in this directory.
