 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =    0.00000000    
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =    0.00000000    

 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.5511437999999877E-002
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =    3.1022875999999755E-003

 Time steps done =            5  out of        13000
