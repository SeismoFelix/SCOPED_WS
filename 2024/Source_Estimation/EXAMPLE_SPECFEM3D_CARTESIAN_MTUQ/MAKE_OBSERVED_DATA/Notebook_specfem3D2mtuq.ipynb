    "The following Notebook provides instructions for running the script specfem3D2mtuq.py. This script reads plain text synthetic seismograms created by Specfem3D Cartesian and convert them into SAC files with the format required by MTUQ for input observed data. The aim of such synthetic \"observed\" data is to run synthetic MTUQ moment tensor estimations. specfem3D2mtuq.py runs in the same environment used for mtuq (conda activate mtuq).  However, you will need to install the **[pyproj](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyproj)** library in the MTUQ environment. "
