 If you have elements of a single type (all acoustic, all elastic, all poroelast
 ic, and without CPML)
 in the whole mesh, then there should be no significant imbalance in the above n
 umbers.
 Otherwise, it is normal to have imbalance in elements and points because the do
 main decomposer
 compensates for the different cost of different elements by partitioning them u
 nevenly among processes.
